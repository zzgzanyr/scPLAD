    """
    Baseline model that predicts the perturbed expression for a cell by returning
    the cell-type-specific average expression computed from perturbed cells in the training data.

    Implementation details:
      - During training (in on_fit_start), we iterate over the training dataloader,
        and for each cell type, we accumulate sums and counts for cells with
        pert_name != self.control_pert.
      - For each cell type, we compute:
            celltype_mean = sum(expression) / count
      - At inference, for each sample in the batch, we look up its cell type and return
        the corresponding average perturbed expression.
      - If the cell type of a sample at inference was not observed during training,
        an assertion error is raised.
